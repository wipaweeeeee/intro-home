        question: "Grab a tea or coffee in the lounge",
        answer: "We are passionate about creating authentic community together. The doors to the auditorium open just before the service starts, because we know that community begins with connection. Our lounge is such a good connection point. We have refreshments like coffee, a selection of teas, and water available in our lounge. We also have a prayer and praise station in the lounge where you can submit prayer requests.",

        question: "What's the church service like?",
        answer: "The service itself is quite relaxed. The music (we call it worship, because the songs are about God) is modern, the lyrics are displayed on TV’s, so are the bible readings in the message. The message is always based on the bible, it should be easy to understand but can also have a challenging element. Challenge is important to us because we hope to become more like Jesus. We have an offering moment in every service. This is for people who call Intro home. There is no obligation or pressure for guests and visitors to give.",

        question: "What about kids?",
        answer: "We have Intro Kids for Primary kids aged 2+. When you arrive you can register your kids in the lounge. They will be in the service for worship (music). In the middle of the service we have a “three minute mingle” a short break when you can take your registered child to the lounge where the team will take them up to the Intro Kids room. The team will bring them back at the end of the service.",

        question: "Anything happen after the service?",
        answer: "We believe that church is not a program so we continue to hang out for food and and making new friends. Also every Sunday 15 minutes after the service we are running Intro Essentials  made up of three steps that equip you to 1) connect to the church, 2) discover the strengths of your purposeful design, 3) develop your God-given gifts to make a difference in the lives of others.",
