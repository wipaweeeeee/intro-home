    familyContent: <span>We have been in ministry for nearly 10 years, and it was while serving in London when God dropped in our hearts a desire to reach Eastern Europe. The dream of planting churches in Romania became more and more real. We met with our senior pastors and with their blessing we started this incredible journey of faith, believing God that He is going to reach millions of people through us obeying Him. So, in July 2021, in an extraordinary step of faith, we relocated our family to Bucharest, much of it self-funded, and full of faith that God has big plans for this part of the world. <br /><br />
      So, we are looking forward to the journey ahead to launch Intro Home Bucharest. <br /><br />
